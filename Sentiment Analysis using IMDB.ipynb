was great a silent comedian but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies  In my opinion Chaplin s voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous  His career never recovered when sound came to film  Contrary to most of the reviews I have read Chaplin s lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by Chaplin the comedian and not spend their entertainment dollar watching Chaplin s political commentary Despite Chaplin s awards and knighthood I would take exception to his contributions to humanity  The Great Dictator was made at the same time Stalin s brutal dictatorship was having it s show trials and both Dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of Poland by both Dictators  WWII started in an attempt to save Poland  The Nazi s were defeated in  years but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country  This happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of Hollywood by the Federal government  Had Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satirein addition to including the Italian dictator perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians  The Soviet s mistreatment of Jews and dissidents exceeded the Nazi s in time and numbers Judged simply as a film many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers who wouldn t know who Goebbels Goring or Mussolini were  A classic piece of art must stand the test of time  Classic Greek Tragedy the Mona Lisa and Beethoven s th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless  Films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made  But those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me Chaplin as the writer director and lead actor must take the blame for what I judge as a dated and tiresome film Chaplin s apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous  If Chaplin found the US so offensive why didn t he return to his native land  Great Britian fought the Nazi with blood and money  What did Switzerland contribute in the fight against the European dictators Switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class and cares little about people who can t join the club
